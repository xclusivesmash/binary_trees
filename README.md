# C - Binary trees

## Project Description
> This repository is created based on developing an understanding of binary trees as an alternative form of data structures. This is part of learning software engineering at ALX SE programme. The goal is to learn by building real-world projects.

## Objectives
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements

### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`.
- OS: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Version of `gcc`: 9.3.0
- Style Guide: [Betty Style](https://github.com/alx-tools/Betty/wiki)

## Printing the structures
