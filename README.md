# C - Binary trees

## Description
> Data structures are important in software engineering for mainly their usability in arranging, managing, and accessing data in easier formats for faster computational reasons.

## Learning objectives
- Understanding what binary trees are.
- Know the difference between a binary tree and a binary search tree.
- Possible gains in terms of time complexity as compared to linked lists.
- know the depth, height, and size of binary tree.
- Understand different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
- Know the difference between a complete, full, perfect, and a balanced binary tree.

## Requirements
- OS: `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS`
- Language(s): `C`
- Compiler: `gcc`
- Style Guide: [Betty]()
- All header files should be include guarded.

## Scripts
0. **1-binary_tree_insert_left.c** - inserts a node as a left child of another node.
    * Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
